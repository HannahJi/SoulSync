Hi, welcome here.

This is a project where I explore the connection between two of my facourite things - music and mental wellness. I strongly believe that music can bring so many things to us human besides the joy of listening itself. The lyrics, the genres, the artist style, the era - which songs you listen to all tell a story about yourself, and vice verse, right songs recommended to you can help you going through a lot of emotions.

Thinking SoulSync as your personalized music therapist, by telling it how are you feeling, and sharing couple stories you are going through, it will recommend right songs for you to listen, and give you brand new energy to support you going through what you are feeling.
